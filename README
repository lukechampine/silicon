silicon - simple ncurses text editor
==================================
silicon is a simple ncurses text editor.


Requirements
------------
In order to build silicon you need the ncurses header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (silicon is installed into the
/usr/local namespace by default). Optionally, create a config.h file to 
further configure the editor at compile time. An examples file is provided as 
config.def.h.

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install silicon (use root if
needed):

    make clean install


Running silicon
-------------
Use the following syntax:

	silicon [-r] [-S | -s SYNTAX] [-t TABSTOP] [File]

Where:
-a starts with autoindent
-r opens the file read-only
-S use no syntax colors at all.
-s SYNTAX  lets you specify the syntax colors for this file
-t TABSTOP sets the tabstop for this instance of silicon


Name
----
Silicon is a fork of sandy.
In case you are wondering, sandy was the smartest pet ferret. She died of
cancer though. We were sad and started coding this editor.

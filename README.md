silicon
=======

Silicon is a simplistic modal editor, forked from suckless.org's Sandy.

Sandy can be found here: http://tools.suckless.org/sandy

Silicon (hopefully) retains all of the functionality of Sandy. In addition, there are a few more planned features:

* Multiple cursors
* Line numbers
* Fuzzy search for commands (possibly via dmenu), similar to SublimeText.
* Bracket matching
